# NeoPurple_D.E.M.O_RELEASES
This repository will host the releases of my personal project, Neo Purple.

The project consists of a little demo of a Top-Down Action RPG. All art, sprites, effects and music that may be shown here has been made by me in order to have something to show some of my skills. 

This releases will also be an example of the Shaded Pixel Camera I've been working on, this project is in https://github.com/Jazzzy/ShadedPixelCamera.
